OFWorkshop_ParticleSystem
=========================

In this workshop, we will talk about a basic work- flow of building a particle system in openFrame- works for openFrameworks beginners.

You will learn how to create classes, a better way to organize your project and make basic visuals and animations. The course will provide a bare skeleton of a particle system and add creative visual effects or physics and of course, make it interactive.
